A React, Nextjs app for exploring your biases

## Motivation
I usually lie to myself. I misunderstand situations. I have blind spots in my opinions. Recently, I discovered that writing is 
amazing, it helps me explore my thoughts slowly and offloads the congnitive load of juggling many concepts at once. You can see your 
arguments and arrange them and rearrange them.

This app is a tool for exploration, like writing(and just like writing, I have not build this with a mobile screen in mind). By playing around with it one could gain a better understanding of their underlying biases. I will put up some examples soon. There are more details of the history in `project_documents`

`npm i`

## Running locally

`npm run dev`

## Deploying

## FAQ

* Why are there no numbers on the sliders?

I find myself being really good at "feeling" something is more appealing to me than something else. But when it is time to 
quantify, I gag. So here we can compare things qualitatively and receive the quantitative resulte through the code.
